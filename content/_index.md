        I'm now working on symmetry analysis of unconventional superconductor aiming to conceive the G-L free energy with the coupling of triplet superconductors and dipole interaction.  In this project, I use group theory to analyse the symmetry of system and study the microscopic mechanism using Green's function method. Besides, I write python code to help me calculate the C-G coefficients for decomposition of reducible representation of the symmetry group.
        
        I aspire for new knowledge and have the passion to pursue new researches. I have the ability to think and learn independently and enjoy discussing academic problems with fellows.
